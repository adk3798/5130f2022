In this paper, I will go over recommendation systems, which are algorithms used for
content recommendation. Recommendation systems have become increasingly important on
the Internet as more and more users find themselves on a handful of centralized
websites that use such systems to help decide what content they will be shown. Using
the recommendation system that provides the highest user satisfaction is critical
for modern social media (and many other types of) sites to retain users. Therefore,
exploring the current avaialble algorithms and principles that make a successful
recommendation system is a worthy endeavor.
